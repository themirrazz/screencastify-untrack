## Wait... isn't that uBlock Origin's job?
Yes and no: uBlock Origin only blocks trackers on websites (like screencastify.com), but it doesn't have the ability to block them in Chrome extensions (like Screencastify's extension).
So here, we remove Google Analytics for you, as well as any other trackers we encountered.
